You can just clone the repo, install the dependencies with `npm i`, then start the app with `npm start` and it should run on the localhost specified in the package.json file. The questions are currently in the public/assets folder as questions.txt, but soon it will be able to handle fileupload for txt and json formats. Further down the line it should also accept a config object in json format, and be able to generate the form from the questions based on the inputted config object.
